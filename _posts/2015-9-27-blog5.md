title: Week 5

It feels like we didn’t cover a lot of materials than usual in lecture this week because of the Career Fair on Monday and another guest speaker on Wednesday. On Monday, a lot of people chose not to come to class and Dr. Downing did not give out quizzes. Wednesday’s guest speaker was from the Jet Propulsion Lab working on very cool projects involving Mars and the Curiosity rover. It was exciting to see what the speaker had to say about his experience in JPL and some of the technologies he talked about was just shocking because it felt like something right out of a SF movie. In particular, the OnSight project, which was a collaboration with Microsoft, simulates a 3D environment that the Curiosity rover sees so that scientists can virtually walk around Mars in their office. Here is a short video talking about OnSight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT-ynvI3Lg. I think the speaker said OnSight project was kept as a secret for a long time and it made me wonder about what other secret projects JPL and NASA could possibly be working on. It seems like sky isn’t the limit for computer science as we’re walking on Mars already. 

For lecture, we talked about different categories of iterators: input, output, forward, bidirectional, and random access. By understanding all the properties of different iterators, we would be able to access or sort more efficiently in our code. Somebody posted a link on Piazza that summarized different iterators: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/. 

Tip-of-the-day: http://www.technologyreview.com/news/541126/why-nasa-wants-microsofts-hololens-in-space/.
It’s an article about HoloLens that is used to create the 3D images in the OnSight software. It explains why the technology can be useful in space and gives other links that explains HoloLens a bit more in detail.
